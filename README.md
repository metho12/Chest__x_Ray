# Chest-X-Ray-Images
Pneumonia is a respiratory infection caused by bacteria or viruses; it affects many individuals, especially in developing and underdeveloped nations. This project focuses on detecting pneumonia in x-rays for kids. We employed deep learning to handle the available data with the CNN algorithm to classify it into pneumonia or normal The proposed method achieved an accuracy rate of 92%.

# Approach 
For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low-quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. 
We used CNN to train on a number of chest X-rays and predict whether pneumonia is present or not. We dealt with gray-scale chest X-ray images. We tried models and we found ResNet50 to be the best one, with the highest accuracy.
